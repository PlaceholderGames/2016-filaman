# filaman
Use the MyProject, not MyProject2, that's the original file from Mike's first commit.
You will then have to load the level BULBMAN_ALPHA_FIRST.
Has the 'filaman' model. He's based on the original third person character template but has a few changes:
  - Has a faster running animation
  - Has a smaller jump
  - Can change colours with 1, 2 and 3 between regular, violet and red.
Currently has no other features, any questions please ask me (Callum).
